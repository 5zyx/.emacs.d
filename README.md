Personal Emacs Configuration
============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seagle0128/.emacs.d.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seagle0128/.emacs.d)

This is an Emacs distribution that aims to enhance the default
Emacs experience. It alters a lot of the default settings,
bundles a plethora of additional packages and adds its own core
library to the mix. The final product offers an easy to use Emacs
configuration for Emacs newcomers and lots of additional power for
Emacs power users.

It is compatible **ONLY with GNU Emacs 24.4 and above**. In general you're
advised to always run with the latest Emacs - currently **25.1**.

# Quick Start

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d.git
